# Basic Coding Concepts in Python

## 1. Variables

In Python, a variable is a placeholder for data. It can hold various types of information, such as numbers, text, or boolean values. For instance:

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
Here, name stores the text "John," and age holds the number 25.
```

## 2. Functions

Functions in Python are blocks of code that perform specific tasks when called. For example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Alice")
```

This greet function takes a name as input and prints a greeting.

## 3. Control Flow
Python uses control flow statements, like if and else, to make decisions:

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```
This code checks if age is 18 or older and prints the corresponding message.

## 4. Iterations (Loops)
Loops in Python allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is commonly used:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration", i + 1)
```
This loop prints "Iteration 1" through "Iteration 5". Python also has while loops for iteration.

## 5. Comments
Comments in Python are used to explain code and are ignored by the interpreter. Single-line comments start with #, while multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """).


```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

```python
# This is a
# multi-line comment
```

## 6. Data Types

Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans:

```python
price = 99.99  # Float
quantity = 5    # Integer
is_available = True  # Boolean
```

Here, price is a float (decimal), quantity is an integer, and is_available is a boolean.


# Conclusion
Remember, these concepts provide a foundation, and Python offers much more to explore!
