# Basic Coding Terminology for Beginners

1. **Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or accomplishing a task in a certain number of steps.

2. **Variable:** A container for storing data values. In programming, variables have a name and a data type.

3. **Data Type:** Specifies the type of data that a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc.

4. **Conditional Statements:** Statements that allow the execution of different code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. Examples include if statements and switch statements.

5. **Loop:** A control structure that repeats a certain block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Common types include for loops and while loops.

6. **Function:** A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are designed to be called, or invoked, when needed.

7. **Array:** A data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays can hold values of the same data type.

8. **String:** A sequence of characters. Strings are often used to represent text in programming.

9. **Comment:** A piece of text within the code that is not executed. Comments are used to provide explanations or annotations for the code.

10. **Syntax:** The set of rules that dictate how programs are written in a particular programming language. Code must follow the syntax to be valid and executable.

11. **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.

12. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. It typically includes a code editor, debugger, and compiler.

13. **Compiler:** A program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code that can be executed.

14. **Variable Scope:** The region of a program where a variable can be accessed or modified.

15. **Boolean:** A data type that represents either true or false.

16. **Operator:** Symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands. Examples include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).

17. **Syntax Error:** An error that occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language.

18. **Runtime Error:** An error that occurs while the program is running, often due to unexpected input or conditions.

19. **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in a program.

20. **Version Control:** A system that tracks changes to a codebase over time. Git is a popular version control system.
